Welcome to Peersity! <br /><br />

These terms of service outline the rules and regulations for the use of Peersity's website, located at <a href="https://www.peersity.in">https://www.peersity.in</a> <br /><br />
The following terminology applies to these Terms of Service, License and all agreements: "Client", "You" and "Your" refers to you, the person logging on to this website and compliant to the Company’s terms and conditions. "The Company", "Ourselves", "We", "Our" and "Us", refers to our Company. "Party", "Parties", or "Us", refers to both the Client and ourselves. All terms refer to the offer, acceptance and consideration of payment necessary to undertake the process of our assistance to the Client in the most appropriate manner for the express purpose of meeting the Client’s needs in respect of provision of the Company’s stated services, in accordance with and subject to, prevailing law of Netherlands. Any use of the above terminology or other words in the singular, plural, capitalisation and/or he/she or they, are taken as interchangeable and therefore as referring to the same.
<br /><br />

<h2>Your commitment to Peersity and its community</h2>

We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we need you to make the following commitments:
What you can share and do on Peersity
We want people to use Peersity to express themselves and to share content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so):
<br /><br />
<ol>
<li>You may not use our Products to do or share anything:</li>
<ul>
<li>That breaches these Terms, our Community Standards, and other Terms and Policies that apply to your use of Peersity.</li>
<li>That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent.</li>
<li>That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights.</li>
</ul>
<li>You may not upload viruses or malicious code, or do anything that could disable, overburden or impair the proper working or appearance of our Products.</li>
<li>You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data that you do not have permission to access.</li>
</ol>
We can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these provisions.
If we remove content that you have shared in violation of our Community Standards, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.
<br /><br />

To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual property rights) or our terms and policies.
<br /><br />

We also can remove or restrict access to your content, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Peersity.
<br /><br />

<h2>The permissions you give us</h2>

We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:
<br /><br />

Specifically, when you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems.

<h2>Updating our Terms</h2>
We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better for you and our community.

We will only make changes if the provisions are no longer appropriate or if they are incomplete, and only if the changes are reasonable and take due account of your interests.
<br /><br />

We will notify you (for example, by email or through our Products) at least 1 week before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect, unless changes are required by law. Once any updated Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our Products.
